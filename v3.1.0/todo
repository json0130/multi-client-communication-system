MVP:
[✅] Add logging into db from server side
[✅] Build local vector DB at startup from existing logs in DB
[✅] Add RAG and test on postman with server endpoints
[] Add bertopic
[] Only use mongodb as the vector db too, no local FAISS

for testing:
[] Add endpoint for dumping (ie. preload) sample data into the DB

stretch:
[] add per-user logs
